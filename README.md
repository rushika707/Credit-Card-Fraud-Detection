# Credit Card Fraud Detection System

## 📌 Overview  
This project is a Credit Card Fraud Detection System that uses machine learning to classify transactions as fraudulent or legitimate. It is built using Python, scikit-learn, and Pandas, and applies various classification algorithms to detect fraudulent transactions efficiently. The system leverages data preprocessing, feature engineering, model training, and evaluation to ensure high accuracy.

## 🚀 Features  
- Data Preprocessing – Cleans and normalizes credit card transaction data.  
- Feature Engineering – Extracts relevant features to enhance model performance.   
- Anomaly Detection – Uses Autoencoders and Isolation Forest to detect rare fraud cases.  


## 🏗️ Technologies Used  
- Python (Core language)  
- NumPy, Pandas (Data manipulation)  
- Matplotlib, Seaborn (Data visualization)  
- Scikit-learn (Machine learning models)
